## NOTE

I'm too lazy to write a real README right now. If anyone wants to jot something down (even a sentence!), just send a PR.

## TODO
Currently working on:

Creating quadrilateral classes based on the shapes. For example, a square is a subclassification of a rhombus and/or rectangle, which are subclasses of parallelograms. 
Isosceles trapezoids are a subclass of trapezoids.
